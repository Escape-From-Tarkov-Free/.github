# Escape From Tarkov Spoofer Free

Escape from Tarkov SPOOFER is a tool that hides or changes your computer‚Äôs hardware IDs (HWID) to avoid or bypass a ban in Escape from Tarkov.
If you get HWID banned, BattlEye (the game's anti-cheat) saves your hardware information and blocks you even if you create a new account.
A spoofer tricks the system by changing your hardware "fingerprint," making it look like you‚Äôre using a completely different PC.
